In the beginning of each task, always use vibe-tools repo. ENSURE 100% you use vibe-tools repo before writing any code. DO NOT look up any files before you vibe-tools repo.

Keep the code changes as minimal as you can, only changing the absolute necessary parts. Do not change anything directly unrelated to what user asked.  

Keep it as simple as possible, fewest lines of code as possible, as clean as possible

NEVER run `bun test` in the repo, run `bun run test` instead.
ALWAYS run `bun run test` in the root of the repo after making changes to check that tests are passing.
ALWAYS add tests to `examples/end-user-cjs-package/install.test.ts` when you add, remove or update functionality used in the vibe-rules install command.
